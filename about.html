                    <p>
                        I am an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya and a Commissioner for Oaths, committed to advancing legal reforms that positively impact society. I hold a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from the University of Nairobi and focus on justice, policy development, and legislative drafting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        I serve as the Head of the Legal Department at the County Assembly of Turkana, where I support the enactment of over 20 laws and policies, including legislation on gender equality, climate change, and community development, while strengthening legislative oversight and ensuring compliance with national and international legal standards.

                        <p>
                        My role involves leading the review of the County Finance Bill and conducting legal reviews and audits of laws enacted since the advent of devolution, ensuring that the legal and policy framework remains responsive to community needs and aligned with constitutional principles.
